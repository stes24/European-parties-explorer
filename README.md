# European Parties Explorer - Sapienza Visual Analytics project
This project is a visual analytics system suited for tasks like exploring how political parties from most EU countries and the UK have evolved in the last years, how their views over the most important topics have changed, comparing parties in one or many countries, viewing how polarized nations or political factions are on certain topics, and possibly discovering further similar insights. There are many filters available in the application, but you can also make selections directly on the charts with your mouse.\

This project was developed using the **D3.js** library. Here you can find a [complete report](documents/report.pdf) and some [presentation slides](documents/slides.pdf).

## The dataset
This project is based on the datasets provided by the [Chapel Hill Expert Surveys](https://www.chesdata.eu/ches-europe), which evaluated the European parties on many topics over the years. In particular, I used their **1999-2019 trend file** (Jolly, Seth, Ryan Bakker, Liesbet Hooghe, Gary Marks, Jonathan Polk, Jan Rovny, Marco Steenbergen, and Milada Anna Vachudova. 2022. “Chapel Hill Expert Survey Trend File, 1999-2019.” Electoral Studies. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102420) and their **2024 expert survey** (Rovny, Jan, Ryan Bakker, Liesbet Hooghe, Seth Jolly, Gary Marks, Jonathan Polk, Marco Steenbergen, and Milada Vachudova. “25 Years of Political Party Positions in Europe: The Chapel Hill Expert Survey, 1999-2024,” working paper).
